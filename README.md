This is a simple  web-based Quiz App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my internship project. The application allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback, and view their final score with a graphical analysis. It contains features like:

*Dynamic question loading (10 questions)

 *Instant feedback on answer selection

 *Question numbering and progress bar

 *Final score display

*Score bar graph visualization

This project was created for hands-on learning during my first internship. It helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling in JavaScript, and creating interactive user interfaces and how to create the basic bignner level web application .
